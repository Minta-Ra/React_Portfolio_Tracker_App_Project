## Project brief

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.


## MVP

- view total current value.
- view individual and total performance trends.
- retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
- View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

## Extensions

- View current share price of individual shareholdings.
- View average and total paid prices of individual shares in the portfolio.
- View a chart of total paid price, total value, profit, or loss.
- Implement a search box to find a specific stock from an external API.
